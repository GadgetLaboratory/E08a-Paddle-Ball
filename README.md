Hey, Larry here.
Soooo... working with Godot.  It's proving to be pretty interesting!  Physics, collision, stuff like that.  I might enjoy this tool as I struggle to catch up and re-exist in this class.  (Funny thing, this is immediately following the Game Jam; I'm that far behind, and spoiler, my team and I worked on a space shooter using this platform.  It'll feel nice actually knowing what the fuck the programming side was all about, pardon my French.)

The goal here was to... well, mainly, do the exercise, and set up the basic workings of a Breakout game.  Honestly, just this experience alone was enough to help me get a good handle on this program even if it IS 3:30 in the morning right now, what with collision and physics and all.  Trying to learn how to match stuff on top of its designation for proper positioning was a little dumb, but the learning experience I took away from it in the end will be of great help to me.  Hopefully, I can make a pretty damn cool Breakout game with this as I advance.
